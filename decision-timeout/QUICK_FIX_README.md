# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix for Database Issue

## Current Problem
The `{}` error means your Supabase `decisions` table either:
1. Doesn't exist yet
2. Has wrong permissions/RLS policies  
3. Has connection issues

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE FIX OPTIONS

### Option A: Setup Database (Recommended)
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Click your project â†’ **SQL Editor**
3. Copy **ALL** content from `setup_database.sql` 
4. Paste and click **Run**
5. Refresh your app - should work!

### Option B: Temporary Bypass (Testing Only)
If you want to test the UI without database, I can create a demo mode.

## ðŸŽ¯ What the SQL Does
- Creates `decisions` table with proper structure
- Adds Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Grants permissions to authenticated/anonymous users
- Adds performance indexes
- Includes `confidence_level` column for psychological tracking

## âœ… After Setup
Your app will have:
- Working decision creation and saving
- Complete decision history with stats
- Confidence tracking in database
- Proper user data isolation

## ðŸ†˜ Still Having Issues?
Check browser console for:
- "Supabase connection test:" messages
- Detailed error information
- User ID verification

The setup should take 30 seconds and fix everything!
